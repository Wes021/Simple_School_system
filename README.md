# Simple_School_system
This is a very simple school system, it consists of two options:
1-Add student, which is as appears used to add new students 
2- Student info, which is used to retrieve student information using thier ID number since it's the key.
The system uses JAVA DB, I couldn't the repository with the used database because it's almost impossible, plus i couldn't use an external database because it's very hard to connect it with NetBeans IDE 8.2
